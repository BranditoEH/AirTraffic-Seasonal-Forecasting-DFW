# AirTraffic-Seasonal-Forecasting

## Overview
This repository hosts the analysis of seasonal flight demand at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW) during the year 2022. The project examines flight patterns using ANOVA and linear regression to inform operational planning.

## Project Introduction
- Introduction to seasonal flight demand analysis.
- Objective to optimize airport operations through data-driven insights.

## Dataset Description
- Data collected from the OpenSky Network.
- Variables: 'typecode', 'weekday', 'month', 'year', 'season', 'num_flights'.

## Hypotheses
- H0: No seasonal variation in flight demand at DFW.
- H1: Significant seasonal variation in flight demand at DFW.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and conversion into datetime format.
- Seasonal categorization aligned with DFW's meteorological patterns.

## Model Development
- Development of a one-way ANOVA test to assess seasonal differences.
- Implementation of a linear regression model to predict flight demand.

## Results and Discussion
- F-value and p-value interpretation from the ANOVA test.
- R-squared and MSE from the linear regression model.
- Cross-validation scores to evaluate model consistency.

## Conclusions
- Insights into flight demand stability throughout 2022.
- Implications for resource allocation and operational strategy at DFW.

## Future Work
- Suggestions to incorporate additional variables for a more comprehensive model.

## Installation
- Instructions on setting up the environment to run the analysis.

## Usage
- Steps to execute the models and interpret the results.

## Contributing
- Guidelines for contributing to the project.

## License
- Details of the license under which this project is released.

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to those who provided data, guidance, and resources for this analysis.
