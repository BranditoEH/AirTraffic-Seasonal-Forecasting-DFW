# Aircraft-Maintenance-Forecasting
## Overview
This repository contains the work for a capstone project focused on predicting aircraft maintenance needs based on operational patterns at high traffic airports. The project utilizes a logistic regression model to estimate the likelihood of maintenance based on the number of flight cycles.

## Project Introduction
- Briefly introduce the concept of predictive maintenance and its importance in the aviation industry.
- Explain the aim and the scope of the capstone project.

## Dataset Description
- Outline the structure of the dataset used.
- Describe the variables included in the dataset and their significance.

## Hypothesis
- Detail the hypothesis that frequent takeoffs and landings have a different impact on aircraft maintenance needs than flight duration.

## Methodology
- Explain the approach taken to prepare the data for analysis.
- Describe the steps involved in the exploratory data analysis.

## Model Development
- Discuss how the logistic regression model was chosen for the project.
- Explain the process of feature selection and engineering.
- Outline the model training and validation process.

## Results and Discussion
- Present the key findings from the model.
- Discuss the model's performance and any insights gained from the coefficients.

## Conclusions
- Summarize the implications of the study for airlines and airport operations.
- Reflect on the limitations of the current model.

## Future Work
- Propose enhancements or additional research that could extend the project.
